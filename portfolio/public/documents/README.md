# Documents Folder

This folder should contain the PDF files referenced in the portfolio:

## Required Files:
- `resume.pdf` - Your actual resume in PDF format
- `portfolio.pdf` - A PDF version of your portfolio (optional)

## How to Add Your Resume:
1. Save your resume as `resume.pdf`
2. Place it in this folder (`portfolio/public/documents/`)
3. The "Download PDF Resume" button on the Resume page will then work correctly

## Current Status:
- ❌ `resume.pdf` - Missing (needs to be uploaded)
- ❌ `portfolio.pdf` - Missing (optional)

## Note:
The download links in `src/data/resume.json` point to:
- `/documents/resume.pdf`
- `/documents/portfolio.pdf`

Make sure your PDF files match these exact names.
