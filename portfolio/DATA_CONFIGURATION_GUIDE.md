public/images/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ concerts/           # Concert photos
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ festivals/          # Festival photos
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ acoustic/          # Acoustic session photos
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile/           # Profile pictures
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/          # Project screenshots
```

### Adding Images
1. Place images in appropriate `public/images/` subdirectory
2. Reference them in JSON files: `"/images/concerts/your-photo.jpg"`
3. Use descriptive filenames for better organization

## üîç Data Validation

The data service includes validation methods:

```javascript
const validation = dataService.validateData();
if (!validation.isValid) {
  console.log('Data errors:', validation.errors);
}
```

## üìä Statistics & Analytics

The system automatically calculates statistics from your data:

- **Music Stats**: Concert count, average ratings, festival attendance
- **Skill Levels**: Proficiency tracking and categorization
- **Social Stats**: Follower counts and engagement metrics

## üöÄ Deployment Considerations

### Environment-Specific Data
For different environments (development, staging, production), you can:

1. Create environment-specific JSON files
2. Use build scripts to copy appropriate files
3. Implement environment-based data loading

### Performance Optimization
- JSON files are loaded at build time (static imports)
- No runtime API calls needed
- Fast loading and SEO-friendly

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **JSON Syntax Errors**: Use a JSON validator to check syntax
2. **Missing Required Fields**: Check console for validation errors
3. **Image Not Loading**: Verify path starts with `/images/` and file exists
4. **Data Not Updating**: Clear browser cache and restart development server

### Validation Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] All JSON files have valid syntax
- [ ] Required fields are present (name, email, event titles, etc.)
- [ ] Image paths are correct
- [ ] Dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
- [ ] URLs are properly formatted

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Consistent Formatting**: Use consistent date formats, naming conventions
2. **Descriptive Content**: Write detailed reviews and descriptions
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep upcoming events and skills current
4. **Backup Data**: Keep backups of your JSON files
5. **Version Control**: Track changes to your data files

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **CMS Integration**: Connect to a headless CMS for easier editing
2. **Dynamic Loading**: Load data from APIs for real-time updates
3. **Multi-language Support**: Add language configuration options
4. **Theme Switching**: Allow users to toggle between color schemes
5. **Data Export**: Export data for backup or migration
